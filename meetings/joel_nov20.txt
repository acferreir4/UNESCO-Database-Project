ENG 4000 Meeting Notes
November 20, 2018
Joel Chretien Meeting
----------------

Database schema suggestions:
- Forum
    - Ditch ThreadXML, expensive and pointless to update xml of thread, instead create runtime export function.
    - Can probably ditch last updated and timestamp, Django has pre-determined fields in each table (created_at and updated_at), can use those instead.
        - same goes for all tables where we want to know when something has been updated/created
    - ThreadPosts: might want to reply to a threadpost, therefore include ParentThreadPostID to track which post a user is replying to. Self-reference in table.

- Question/Answers
    - Need supported question/answer types from Katrin.
    - Answers table
        - Store answers as text.
    - Questions table
        - contains answer type
        - need auxiliary table to hold multiple choice options

Deployment:
- DigitalOcean vs Heroku vs AWS
    - DigitalOcean most work/trickiest to get up and running, cheaper, we get to learn devOps stuff.
    - Heroku easier apparently, little more expensive.
    - Dokku (Docker powered mini-Heroku), can be used with both.
    - AWS Lambda pretty cheap, only pay for compute time, so pay nothing when you aren't seeing traffic.
    - Think about who will be maintaining this system when we're gone, should influence our decision.
        - If it's not any of us, will need to write appropriate documentation to bring other devs up to speed with regards to development, 

WBS:
- Iterative approach using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- TravisCI, CircleCI free for open-source github projects, need to determine if this is open-source to see if we can leverage their freeness.
- Set up a continuous deployment workflow, so that deployment becomes less of a headache in the long run.

Test Readiness Doc:
- would like to talk to us about testing when the time comes, future meeting to be set sometime in January
