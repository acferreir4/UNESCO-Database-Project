ENG 4000 Meeting Notes
November 05, 2018
Manos Papangelis Meeting
----------------

Problem/Requirements Refinement:
- Encourages us to think about the need for our database solution, suggests looking into Google Forms, Survey Monkey, etc. 
    - Katrin subsequently clarified the need for our solution:
        - Region/Country data restrictions
        - Simplicity and Responsiveness for low bandwidth areas.

- Dynamic questions and answers is a complex problem.
    - Requires abstract thinking about what a generic question/answer is.
    - Adding new questions/answers will likely propagate throughout the system
        (i.e. database modifications, modifications to views, etc.)
    

Discussion on Techs:
- MySQL & PostgreSQL
    - Suggested we use PostgreSQL, but said it can be done with both.

- Django & Flask
    - Manos has used Django and thinks it's a suitable choice for our needs, 
    - Hasn't heard of Flask.


Deliverables:
- To Manos:
    - Our resumes.
    - Our delivered documents thus far in the course.


Future Meetings:
- Suggested in the future we set up monthly meetings.
- Remain on the fly for now.
- We are free to drop by anytime to ask questions.
